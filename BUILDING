BUILDING USING ECLIPSE

If you are using Eclipse to manage your work with the webpac files, you can configure the
following external programs to build the project from the source files:

merlin_webpac_build_all
  location: ${workspace_loc:/merlin_webpac/bin/build.bat}
  workingdir: ${workspace_loc:/merlin_webpac}
  arguments: -A

merlin_webpac_build_selected
  location: ${workspace_loc:/merlin_webpac/bin/build.bat}
  workingdir: ${workspace_loc:/merlin_webpac}
  arguments: ${resource_name}


BUILDING USING COMMAND LINE

1) cd to your project's root folder in your workspace
2) to buld everything, run: bin/build.bat -A (or build.sh -A if you're using Linux or OSX)
3) to build just one file, run: bin/build.bat [name of file] (or build.sh [name of file])
