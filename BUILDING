merlin_webpac - WebOPAC for the MERLIN Cluster

BUILDING

PRE-REQUISITES

 * A Subversion client. A good client for Windows is TortoiseSVN, available at:
   http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

 * Perl. For Windows, ActivePerl is fine:
   http://www.activestate.com/store/activeperl/download/


This file will eventually contain notes on how to build a new set of html files in the build folder, and then deploy these files to the staging directory, or the live directory, of the MERLIN InnOPAC.
